I enjoy helping people make better decisions by challenging conventional wisdom to solve hard problems with data. 

I currently manage a Data Science team at Wayfair.com. We're tackling problems of customer loyalty and personalization. In addition to my full-time gig, I also do sports analytics consulting on the side. A good friend and I started Cardinal Advising with a goal of bringing state of the art data science and analytics to the sports industry on both the player/personnel and the business sides.

If you're interested in any materials I have used for previous tutorials and course I've taught, be sure to check the [tutorials page](/tutorials/). Although I'm not formally in Academia, I still spend some time working on more academic research. If you're interested in that, take a look at my publications page](/publications/).
